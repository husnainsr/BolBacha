# BolBacha ChatBot ü§ñ

BolBacha is an AI-powered chatbot built on the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It utilizes RAG, CHROMA, and OLLAMA with Model phi3 3.6 Billion parameters to provide interactive conversations and information retrieval capabilities.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) üß†

RAG is a novel approach to conversational AI that combines the benefits of information retrieval with the flexibility of generative models. It allows the chatbot to retrieve relevant information from a large knowledge base and generate responses based on retrieved information.
